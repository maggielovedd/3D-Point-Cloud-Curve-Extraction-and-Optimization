# 3D-Point-Cloud-Curve-Extraction-and-Optimization
This code is designed to extract a representative curve (or a thin center line) from a noisy 3D point cloud, especially when the point cloud has discernible geometric patterns.  Given a noisy point cloud that has an inherent structure or shape, the goal is to identify and trace a continuous curve that best captures the essence of that shape.
